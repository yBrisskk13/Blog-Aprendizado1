        This semester at Núcleo de Línguas – UFES has been a great learning experience for me. Even though I already
        knew some English from interacting with foreign friends and playing games in English, this course helped me
        build a stronger foundation and learn important basics clearly and confidently.

        One of the first topics we covered was the verb "to be." It’s such an important part of English, and now I
        understand how to use it properly to talk about myself, others, and things around me. We practiced forming
        sentences in the present tense and learned how to ask and answer simple questions.

        We also studied nationalities and countries. This was fun because I could relate it to my own experiences
        meeting people from different parts of the world. Learning the correct spelling and pronunciation of country
        names and nationalities helped me feel more confident in conversations.

        Colors was another topic we explored. Although it might seem simple, it was useful to learn all the colors in
        English, how to describe objects, and to build vocabulary step by step.

        One of the most exciting parts of the course was learning about the present continuous tense. This tense allows
        us to talk about actions happening right now, like “I am studying” or “They are playing.” It opened a new way
        for me to describe what’s going on in the moment.

        Overall, this basic English course gave me tools to communicate better and understand more. I’m happy to have
        improved my skills, and I look forward to learning even more in the future!
