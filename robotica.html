Music has always been a big part of my life, and over time, I’ve discovered that Brazilian rap speaks to me more than any other genre. What I love most about it is how these artists talk openly about social issues in Brazil, using their lyrics to highlight the reality of inequality, injustice, and the need for change. Their songs go beyond entertainment — they’re reflections of real life and powerful calls for a better future.

Here are some of my favorite Brazilian rap artists and the songs I connect with most from each of them:

Sid – Brasil de Quem?, Autobiografia, Assalto a Mão Letrada
His lyrics are thoughtful and raw. Sid has a way of telling stories that make you reflect on the country we live in.

Fábio Brazza – Pátria Sonâmbula, Divina Comédia, Divina Comédia 2
Brazza combines poetry with deep social critique. His wordplay and references make each verse feel like a punch to the system.

Tavin – Isso Vale Minha Vida
A strong and emotional track. Tavin brings real intensity and meaning to every line.

Emicida – Principia
Emicida is legendary. His music blends consciousness, creativity, and culture in a way that’s truly inspiring.

Nocivo Shomon – Jack
Nocivo brings raw emotion and honest perspectives that stick with you long after the song ends.

Caym - Adrenalina, Dopamina, Eu Passei Alguns Vários Dias Pensando Sobre Você
Caym’s music is a mix of energy and emotion. His lyrics are relatable, and his beats are infectious.
These artists are just a few of the many voices in Brazilian rap that resonate with me. Their music is a mix of beats, rhythms, and powerful messages that make you think and feel. I love how they use their platforms to speak out about the issues that matter most to them and their communities.
While rap is definitely what I listen to the most these days, I also enjoy a bit of pop, trap, and underground music. I like exploring new artists and sounds, but it's the truth and power in rap that keeps pulling me back.

Music, for me, isn’t just about rhythm or flow — it’s about what it says. And right now, Brazilian rap is saying exactly what needs to be heard.
